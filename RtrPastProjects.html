We visited about 4 schools in Kolar Road, which needed immense help from us in terms of infrastructure such as building roofs and toilets. We decided to get these things to one such school in Nimbekaipura as a beginning and are working towards raising funds for this cause.

This created a lot of awareness among public watching us do all the work and also got a sense of encouragement for all of us to do something towards the environment. This project was completed with the support of Rotaract District 3190.

							We celebrated Independence day by distributing dictionaries to standard 3rd and above in two govt. schools. The greatest benefit will be to the students as it is a critical time for forming good reading habits.  The fact that each student will have their own personal dictionary will allow their teachers to give them special assignments directly relatedto reading and dictionary skills. We distributed over 300 dictionaries.

                            <br><br>We established multi-lingual libraries in St.Antony's Kannada Higher Primary School and Govt. Primary School,Chunchghatta. The schools are provided with colorful English books and local language books along with safe and accessible storage place for the books, so that the children feel comfortable to access the books and nurture their educational curiosities. The library is supervised by a trained librarian, to guide the school staff and children about the precise usage of the books. The entire library scheme is taken up as a stage development program for the kids, where the language improvement of the kids is made calculative and traceable by the librarian through different charts, cards and posters.

                            <br><br>Rotractors of RCB Jayanagar went for an adventure trek to MULAYAN GIRI; the highest peak in  Karnataka on 16 January 2009. Situated at 6,317 feet high from Sea Level, the place is 12 Kms away from Chickmagalur. We had a fun time climbing the 400 staircase which lead us to the peak and served us with a view to cherish for. We were shrinking away to glory because of the early morning breeze and a sweet tinge of sunlight from here and there, which kept us going. A visit to Anaconda falls on our way back was no less than a dessert after an unmemorable time spent.
