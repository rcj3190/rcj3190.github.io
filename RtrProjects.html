      <h2>Current and Upcoming Projects</h2><br/>
      <h1 style="text-align:center;">KADAM AND DISHSA<h1>

      <p><b>I complained about having a torn shoe until I saw a child running barefoot to the school..</b></p>
      <p><b>I complained about not having a shoe until I saw a man with no limbs..</b></p>
      <p>All of our life we have been very fortunate and blessed. And if there's one good thing we all could do, it is to help others in need. For we may be the only ones who actually take small steps in helping the community.</p>
      <p>Service to the society being one of the main objectives, Rotaract Club of Bangalore, Jayanagar has been involved over the years, to help such persons, mainly those who are financially not in a good condition. This year, we have thoughtfully designed two community service projects - <b>DISHA and KADAM</b>, to benefit the differentially abled and children respectively.</p>
      <p>Kadam aims at providing shoes to the underprivileged children of a Government school near Shanthinagar in Bangalore. Most of these children come from Below Poverty Line background and hence do not even have enough money to buy a pair of basic shoes. They walk long distances barefoot to reach their schools. Through this project, we would be providing canvas shoes to all the 190 children in the school. We hope that this will make their walk to the school a very comfortable and happy one. The donation drive is planned on <b>22nd March 2014 in Government Higher Primary School - Tamil, Kannada and Urdu, Puduparacherry, Shantinagar, Bangalore.</b></p>
      <p><b>Artificial Limb Donation</b> is one such initiative, through which artificial/prosthetic limbs are donated to the poor and the needy. Rotaract Club of Bangalore, Jayanagar has a tie-up with Sri Bhagwaan Mahaveer Jain Hospital to arrange for the medical facilities and the personnel to facilitate the limb fitting process in a safe and hygienic manner. This year, <b>the Artificial Limb Donation program - DISHA</b> will be held at <b>Rotary Bal Bhavan ,Chitradurga</b> on the <b>20th of April 2014</b>. It will be surprising to you to know the fact that the cost of one prosthetic/artificial limb is the same as the cost of one pair of branded jeans!</p>
      <p><b>Yes, each prosthetic limb costs only Rs. 1000.</b></p>
      <p>To cater to as many needy persons as possible, we rely on donations to fund the above mentioned programs. Just as small drops of water make an ocean, so each rupee collected will help someone. So, please do not hesitate to contribute whatever you can.</p>
      <p>Your kind gesture can change someone's life for the better. Help us bring smiles on their faces!</p>
      <p>Cheques have to be drawn in the favour of <b>"Rotaract Club of Bangalore, Jayanagar"</b>.</p>
