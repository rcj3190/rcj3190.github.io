        The education program is conducted in the <strong>Orphanage, Uttarahalli</strong> and <strong>Govt. Urdu Primary School, Byrasandra</strong>.
        From the research done by the Rotaractors by visiting various education initiatives in rural schools,
        the approach of this program was to focus on English Educatiom for 1st to 3rd Standard Kids. The program will be
        delivered with the material provided from Akshara Foundation.
      </div>
      <div class="MAINTEXTNORMAL">
        The session is for one hour on Saturdays from 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM.
      </div>
      <div class="MAINTEXTNORMAL">
        Through their In-School programme, Akshara Foundation addresses the children of standards 1 to 5, lending them activity based methods for learning languages –Kannada & English – and Mathematics.  The efficacy of these learning kits are corroborated after thorough analysis of a pilot implementation and today these programmes have been meticulously woven into the curriculum of governmental schools.
      </div>
      <div class="MAINTEXTNORMAL">
        As a strategic step to retain children in Government school, the Karnataka government has decided to start English medium sections in the existing Government Higher Primary schools.
        <br>
        Few of the reasons for this decision are:
        <br>
        1. Drop in enrollment from 6th to 8th grades in Kannada medium schools as more parents prefer low-cost English medium schools.<br>
        2. To provide English education free education to the children of the lower economic sections of the society so that they don't have to pay huge fees in the private English medium schools.<br>
        3. This decision will help migration of families from rural to urban areas in a search of schools imparting education in English.<br>

        It is very clear now that more and more parents have realized the importance of English language and the Government is trying to satisfy this section by institutionalizing English sections in Government schools. <br>
