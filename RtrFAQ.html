                    <div class="MAINTEXTNORMAL">
                       Rotaract is a worldwide organization, with around 8,000 clubs in 140 different countries. There are many things Rotaract has to offer. In a nutshell some of the main things you can expect to gain from becoming a Rotaractor include: 
                        <ul>                          
                            <li>Having heaps of fun while making new friendships that last a lifetime, both here and overseas.  </li>
                            <li>The satisfaction of knowing that you can make a difference, in the local community and overseas. </li> 
                            <li>Pushing yourself to the limit and realising your potential in both personal and professional areas of life. </li>
                        </ul>
                        Primarily, we offer you the opportunity to learn more about yourself, the community, and the world in general, in a safe, supportive, friendly environment. We also offer you the opportunity to contribute something back to society through a range of community and humanitarian projects, while helping you develop your leadership skills, plus there are monthly social activities with other like-minded people.

                    </div>
                    <div class="MAINTEXTNORMAL">
                       Membership is open to all men and women aged between 18 and 30. There is no restriction on race, gender, vocation, religion, political beliefs, etc. Rotaract is a truly non-sectarian service organisation that welcomes everyone.
                       <br>
                       We are a professional organisation that is accountable for every cent we raise, so we need to make sure our members are responsible citizens of good-standing in the community. The vast majority of our members are students and young professionals..

                     <IMG src="./images/globe_48.png" title="" /> <b>What does it cost to join Rotaract?</b>
                    </div>
                    <div class="MAINTEXTNORMAL">
                       Given that many members are students, clubs always try to keep fees and costs to a minimum.
                        This once-off fee is used to cover the cost of items which are given to you when you are inducted as a member. Standard items issued to you when you are inducted are a: 
                        <ul>                          
                            <li>Rotaract lapel pin</li>
                            <li>Membership certificate </li>                             
                        </ul>
                        Other items you may receive upon your induction include
                        <ul>                          
                            <li>Club t-shirt / apparel </li>
                            <li>Membership information pack / file</li>                             
                        </ul>
                        All money we raise from the community is spent back in the community, so the running costs of the club are met by yearly membership fees..

                     <IMG src="./images/globe_48.png" title="" /> <b>How do I start getting involved?</b>
                    </div>
                    <div class="MAINTEXTNORMAL">
                       The first thing to do is find a Rotaract club that suits you. If you would like to try out the Rotaract Club of Jayanagar, have a look at <a href="RtrCalender.html">when we meet</a>. If there aren't any Rotaract clubs in your local community, talk to your local Rotary club and see if they are interested in chartering a new Rotaract club.
                       <br><br>
                       Once you have found a club you like, you need to attend at least 3 of their club ("general") meetings and participate in one project before you can be considered for membership. That way, you can see what you think of the club and what they do, and they can get to know you and see how well you fit into the club.
                    </div>
                    
                     <div class="MAINTEXTNORMAL" >
                     <IMG src="./images/globe_48.png" title="" /> <b>What can I expect at a Rotaract meeting?</b>
                    </div>
                    <div class="MAINTEXTNORMAL">
                       Every Rotaract club runs their meetings a little differently.Hopefully you should find a warm, friendly group of people at a meeting that will last from half an hour to an hour and a half or so. The meeting may or may not have a guest speaker, and will largely comprise of an "information exchange" session where you can find out what is going on, and perhaps some small events, such as a social activity may be organised. 
                    </div>
                    
                     <div class="MAINTEXTNORMAL" >
                     <IMG src="./images/globe_48.png" title="" /> <b>How do I apply to become a member?</b>
                    </div>
                    <div class="MAINTEXTNORMAL">
                       This is done by filling out a Membership Application form. After you have been to a few meetings, hopefully someone in the club - either the President, Membership Officer, or Secretary - will ask you if you are interested in becoming a member and will give you a membership application form, if you haven't already filled one out online. You need to return your completed form to the club's Membership Officer or Secretary (if returning a hard copy) along with your joining fee.
                    </div>
                    
                     <div class="MAINTEXTNORMAL" >
                     <IMG src="./images/globe_48.png" title="" /> <b>Does filling in the membership form guarantee that I will become a member?</b>
                    </div>
                    <div class="MAINTEXTNORMAL">
                       No, it does not. If you indicate on your form that you are not willing to attend 60% of the club's activities, or that you are not willing to pay membership fees, you will not be inducted as a member.
                       <br><br>
                       The membership form indicates your willingness to become a member; the club Board then determines if they think you will fit in with the rest of the club.
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="MAINTEXTNORMAL" >

                    </div>
                    <div class="MAINTEXTNORMAL">
                      The length of time generally depends on you. You should be given a membership form as soon as you are eligible to be considered for membership (ie are between 18 and 29, have attended 3 meetings no more than a month apart and taken part in a community project.
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="MAINTEXTNORMAL" >
                     <IMG src="./images/globe_48.png" title="" /> <b> Do I need to be a member to take part in the activities?</b>
                    </div>
                    <div class="MAINTEXTNORMAL">
                      No, you do not. However, if you attend meetings and projects regularly, you should become a member. It is not fair to the other members who have paid their membership fees to have someone freeloading.
                       <br><br>
                       If you cannot make the 60% attendance requirement to become a member, but would still like to be involved, please discuss your situation with the club. We may be able to make you an Honorary Member or a "Friend of Rotaract", depending on the circumstances
                    </div>

                    </div>
                    <div class="MAINTEXTNORMAL">
                      No, you do not. You need to maintain 60% attendance of meetings in order to remain a member of Rotaract, that is, you do need to attend at least one Rotaract activity each month. If you can't make it to something, we ask that you please let us know so that we don't hold up the start of the meeting waiting for your arrival.
                   </div>

                    <div class="MAINTEXTNORMAL">
                      That's when all the fun begins! Attend the meetings, meet new friends, help out with the projects, go to the social events, develop your leadership skills... what you get out of Rotaract is only limited by what you put into it. If there is something in particular that you would like to achieve during your time in Rotaract, let us know! The activities we do depend on what our members' interests are, and that includes you!
