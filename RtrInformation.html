                    Since 1968, Rotaract has made it possible for thousands of young adults to live out the Rotary ideal. Today, some 155,000 members are working together to build a better future in 146 countries. The latest statistics show 6,747 Rotaract clubs worldwide, sponsored by 6,876 Rotary clubs.

                    Everywhere in the world, Rotaractors have remarkable humanitarian projects to their credit, and have been able to acquire knowledge they can use for their personal growth within a framework of friendship. In this way, they have been able to meet the social and material needs of their community while striving for improved relationships between people.

                    <b>FIRST CLUB:</b> March 13, 2001 marked the 33rd anniversary of the first Rotaract Club to have received its Rotaract certificate of organisation - the club of Charlotte, North Carolina, U.S. Many events, however, had taken place prior to the official creation of Rotaract.

                        <b>PAUL HARRIS:</b> Back in the 1950s, many clubs made up of young adults or students had been created and sponsored by Rotary clubs. 
                        They functioned in a non-official manner and under different names. 
                        As early as 1935, Rotary Founder Paul Harris discovered a youth organisation based on Rotarian principles during a trip to Australia.
                        Take, for example, the "Paul Harris Circles" created in Europe and in particularly significant numbers in Belgium and Italy, or the "Rotors" clubs created in some American universities. 
                        What these organisations had in common is that they were made up of young people, mostly children of Rotarians and their friends. 
                        Their functioning and objectives were similar to those that are the main features of Rotaract clubs today.
