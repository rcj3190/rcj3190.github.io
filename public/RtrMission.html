                       What we do ?

                    <div class="MAINTEXTNORMAL"> 
                    We organise events. Thats it. Simple, ain't it ? But the way of organising and administration is what makes Rotaract exciting
                    </div>
                    <div class="MAINTEXTNORMAL"> 
                    The projects that we organise are categorised into four avenues :
                    </div>
                    <div class="MAINTEXTNORMAL">
                        <ul>
                        <li><b><i>Club Services :</i></b> If it's fun you desire, then Club Services would be your cuppa tea, since this is where the club lets their hair down and goes all out to enjoy themselves. Life is tough and grim and without club services, maintaining sanity is a trifle tough. This is rewarding in terms of personal contacts, increased interaction between members of the same club, and between different clubs too. This is as much a part of the Rotaract club as anything else, since all work and no play makes.... (well... you know that). 

                       <li><b><i> Community Services :</i></b> This is what most people see as the public face of Rotaract. This is quite an important facet of the club but by no measure of anyone's imagination is this avenue the most dominating of all event avenues. Activities under this head include Vaccinations, Education Drives, Awareness Camps, and Lecture Series. 

                        <li><b><i>International Services :</i></b> This is considered the glam part of Rotaract services, and is too. International exchanges, education crossovers, culture visit exchanges, and other international events ( By international, we include all events happening outside Bangalore) comprise this avenue. A great way to visit other cultures, to experience newer sights and sounds, and to enrich your value system. 

                        <li><b><i>Professional Services :</i></b> This avenue is for all those students who are undecided about their careers, and for those career people who need updates / honing of skills to stay competent in their line of business. Lecture Series, Workshops, Career Guidance, Self-Improvement Courses, etc are some project ideas that are part of this avenue. 
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="MAINTEXTNORMAL"> 
                    The projects or events are planned and organised by a team selected from the Club itself who have the responsibility of the project right from the planning stage till the execution. There are projects organised beyond the Club level meaning - organised by more than one club coming together which are joint projects or District projects. Such projects are a platform to know more people and interact with them.
